#Jquery demo for Tree Traversal

##Initiating Project Application

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. Navigate to this project's root directory
3. `Run npm install`
4. `Run bower install`


##Run the presentation in the browser:

1. Add a new tab to your terminal and initiate `gulp`
2. In the other tab open up your sublime text (`subl .`) in the main directory of the Project
3. Open project in "`localhost:8080`" in the Chrome browser.
4. Open the javascript console in Chrome and be sure to be at the highest resolution possible ("No less than 1360px width of screen")

-Follow along in the app.js file in the public/js directory

##Tasks 

###Learn to understand Tree Traversal and efffectivly use its functions

- find()
- siblings() 
- children() 
- parent() 
- parents() 
- closest()â€¨

###Step 1: find();
The .find() method allows us to find all the descendants of specified element in the DOM tree.


1. Use Jquery method find() to look for all the children of Div class `row`.
2. Then set up an on click function to highlight all the children in the Div class `row`.

###Step 2: siblings();
The .siblings() method allows us to find all the siblings of a specified element in the DOM tree.

1. Use JQuery method siblings to find all of the sublings of Div class `nav_home`.
2. Then set up a function to change the background color of each of the siblings to red.

###Step 3: children();
The .children() method allows us to find the children of a specified element in the DOM tree.
This selector is very similar to `find()`, however the children selector only goes down 1 section of a tree.

1. Use JQuery method children() to find all the children of parent  `desktop_logo`.
2. Then set up a function to hide the child elements using the CSS property visibility.

###Step 4: Parent();
The parent() method traverses to the immediate parent of a specified element in the DOM tree

1. Use JQuery method parent() to find the immediate parent of the Div class `hero`.
2. Then set up a function to console.log the result of the function.

###Step 5: parents();
The .parents() method allows us to search through the ancestors of a specified element in the DOM tree.
Again another very similar function this time for parent. You can think of the parent() method as your `immediate parent`(ie.your mom or your dad) and the parents() method as a representation of your `ancestors`(ie. your grandparents and their parents) all the way to the begining.

1. Use JQuery method parents() to find all the parents of Div class Span class `nameof`.
2. Then set up a function to console.log the result of the function.
Note: the syntax of the method states that it will return the results of the method in reversed order despite the fact that it searches from the bottom up

###Step 6: closest();
The .closest() method searches through the element and their ancestors in the DOM tree for a specified perameter (ie. objects, elements, and strings.ect) and then stops when it finds the `first` matching result.
This is method very similar to `parent()` in the sense that it only producess one result, However the closest() method can traverse throughout the tree to find a result instead of taking the first imediate parent that the parent() method does.

1. Use JQuery method closest() to find the first `div` of the ul class `main_nav`.
2. Then set up a function to console.log the result of the function.
