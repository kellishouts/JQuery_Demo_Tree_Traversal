##Tasks 

###Learn to understand Tree Traversal and efffectivly use its functions

- find()
- siblings() 
- children() 
- parent() 
- parents() 
- closest()â€¨

###Step 1: find();
The .find() method allows us to search through the descendants of specified elements in the DOM tree.


1. Use Jquery function find() to look for all the children of Div class `row`.
2. Then set up an on click function to highlight all the children in the Div class `row`.

###Step2: siblings();
The .siblings() method allows us to search through the siblings of a specified element in the DOM tree

1. Use JQuery function siblings to find all of the sublings of Div class `nav_home`.
2. Then set up a function to change the background color of each of the siblings to red.
